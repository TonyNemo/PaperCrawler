(2017) recently proposed a fully unsupervised machine translation (MT) model. The model relies heavily on an adversarial, unsupervised cross-lingual word embedding technique for bilingual dictionary induction (Conneau et al., 2017), which we examine here. Our results identify the limitations of current unsupervised MT: unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performs much worse on morphologically rich languages that are not dependent marking, when monolingual corpora from different domains or different embedding algorithms are used. We show that a simple trick, exploiting a weak supervision signal from identical words, enables more robust induction and establish a near-perfect correlation between unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction performance and a previously unexplored graph similarity metric.\">\\n        <a class=\"cal-link\" title=\"View schedule entry for \\'On the Limitations of Unsupervised Bilingual Dictionary Induction\\'\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../schedule/#paper-721\"><i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i></a>\\n        <span class=\"paper-title\"><a href=\"/paper/721\">On the Limitations of Unsupervised Bilingual Dictionary Induction</a></span>. \\n        <span class=\"paper-authors\">Anders S\\xc3\\xb8gaard, Sebastian Ruder, Ivan Vuli\\xc4\\x87</span>.\\n    </li>\\n\\n    <li class=\"listing\" title=\"ABSTRACT: In this paper we present the Exemplar Encoder-Decoder network (EED), a novel conversation model that learns to utilize \\\\textit{similar} examples from training data to generate responses.

This paper proposes a forest-based NMT method that translates a linearized packed forest under a simple sequence-to-sequence framework (i.e., a forest-to-sequence NMT model).

Different from captions, stories have more expressive language styles and contain many imaginary concepts that do not appear in the images. Thus it poses challenges to behavioral cloning algorithms. Furthermore, due to the limitations of automatic metrics on evaluating story quality, reinforcement learning methods with hand-crafted rewards also face difficulties in gaining an overall performance boost. Therefore, we propose an Adversarial REward Learning (AREL) framework to learn an implicit reward function from human demonstrations, and then optimize policy search with the learned reward function. Though automatic evaluation indicates slight performance boost over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in cloning expert behaviors, human evaluation shows that our approach achieves significant improvement in generating more human-like stories than SOTA systems.\">\\n        <a class=\"cal-link\" title=\"View schedule entry for \\'No Metrics Are Perfect: Adversarial Reward Learning for Visual Storytelling\\'\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../schedule/#paper-308\"><i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i></a>\\n        <span class=\"paper-title\"><a href=\"/paper/308\">No Metrics Are Perfect: Adversarial Reward Learning for Visual Storytelling</a></span>. \\n        <span class=\"paper-authors\">Xin Wang, Wenhu Chen, Yuan-Fang Wang, William Yang Wang</span>.\\n    </li>\\n\\n    <li class=\"listing\" title=\"ABSTRACT: We propose DuoRC, a novel dataset for Reading Comprehension (RC) that motivates several new challenges for neural approaches in language understanding beyond those offered by existing RC datasets. DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question-answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie - one from Wikipedia and the other from IMDb - written by two different authors. We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language understanding and incorporating external background knowledge. Additionally, the narrative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive passages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we observe that state-of-the-art neural RC models which have achieved near human performance on the SQuAD dataset, even when coupled with traditional NLP techniques to address the challenges presented in DuoRC exhibit very poor performance (F1 score of 37.42% on DuoRC v/s 86% on SQuAD dataset).

Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to feed into the QA model.

Furthermore, we regard candidate extraction as a latent variable and train the two-stage process jointly with reinforcement learning. As a result, our approach has improved the state-of-the-art performance significantly on two challenging open-domain reading comprehension datasets. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our model components, especially the information fusion of all the candidates and the joint training of the extract-then-select procedure.\">\\n        <a class=\"cal-link\" title=\"View schedule entry for \\'Joint Training of Candidate Extraction and Answer Selection for Reading Comprehension\\'\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../schedule/#paper-767\"><i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i></a>\\n        <span class=\"paper-title\"><a href=\"/paper/767\">Joint Training of Candidate Extraction and Answer Selection for Reading Comprehension</a></span>. \\n        <span class=\"paper-authors\">Zhen Wang, Jiachen Liu, Xinyan Xiao, Yajuan Lyu, Tian Wu</span>.\\n    </li>\\n\\n    <li class=\"listing\" title=\"ABSTRACT: We introduce the novel task of predicting adverbial presupposition triggers, which is useful for natural language generation tasks such as summarization and dialogue systems.

The relevance signals are extracted through a gated convolutional process. The gate mechanism controls which convolution filters output the relevance signals in a category dependent manner.

We experiment with three strategies: (1) a source-side bridging model, where source word embeddings are moved one step closer to the output target sequence; (2) a target-side bridging model, which explores the more relevant source word embeddings for the prediction of the target sequence; and (3) a direct bridging model, which directly connects source and target word embeddings seeking to minimize errors in the translation of ones by the others.

We found such monotonicity forces the algorithm to sacrifice some good decoding paths. To mitigate this problem, we relax the monotonic constraint of the beam search by maintaining all found hypotheses in a single priority queue and using a universal score function for hypothesis selection. The proposed algorithm allows discarded hypotheses to be recovered in a later step.

However, statistical word segmentation methods have recently shown to be prone to morphological errors, which can lead to inaccurate translations. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by replacing the source-language embedding layer of NMT with a bi-directional recurrent neural network that generates compositional representations of the input at any desired level of granularity. We test our approach in a low-resource setting with five languages from different morphological typologies, and under different composition assumptions. By training NMT to compose word representations from character n-grams, our approach consistently outperforms (from 1.71 to 2.48 BLEU points) NMT learning embeddings of statistically generated sub-word units.\">\\n        <a class=\"cal-link\" title=\"View schedule entry for \\'Compositional Representation of Morphologically-Rich Input for Neural Machine Translation\\'\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../schedule/#paper-762\"><i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i></a>\\n        <span class=\"paper-title\"><a href=\"/paper/762\">Compositional Representation of Morphologically-Rich Input for Neural Machine Translation</a></span>. \\n        <span class=\"paper-authors\">Duygu Ataman, Marcello Federico</span>.\\n    </li>\\n\\n    <li class=\"listing\" title=\"ABSTRACT: Recently, span-based constituency parsing has achieved competitive accuracies with extremely simple models by using bidirectional RNNs to model ``spans\\'\\'.

A comparative evaluation shows that our model is competitive with the existing spell checking and correction techniques for Indic languages.\">\\n        <a class=\"cal-link\" title=\"View schedule entry for \\'Automatic Spelling Correction for Resource-Scarce Languages using Deep Learning\\'\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../schedule/#paper-59-srw\"><i class=\"far fa-calendar-alt\"></i></a>\\n        <span class=\"paper-title\"><a href=\"/paper/59-srw\">Automatic Spelling Correction for Resource-Scarce Languages using Deep Learning</a></span>. \\n        <span class=\"paper-authors\">Pravallika Etoori, Manoj Chinnakotla, Radhika Mamidi</span>.\\n    </li>\\n\\n    <li class=\"listing\" title=\"ABSTRACT: Modern question answering systems have been touted as approaching human performance.
